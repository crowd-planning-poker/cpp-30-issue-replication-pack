wtrocki$*$h4. Update
Created alternative approach that is using Dagger like provider interface but without dagger:
https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-android-sdk/pull/10
wtrocki$*$h4. Update
I have done research for the work. Currently our SDK is implementing similar approach to Dagger2. 
I posted some attempts to spike it as part of:
https://github.com/secondsun/aerogear-android-sdk/pull/1
Alternative, in-house option is done as part of the
https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-android-sdk/pull/2
h4. Moving to dagger
TL;DR - My take here is that dagger is perfect for end user application but not flexible choice for library.  
Moving to dagger is not possible and will not provide any benefit.
- Library is designed where injectors need to connected with providers on top level application.
This will complicate user api as they will need to provide local bindings. 
In our case this will be so cumbersome and will just overcomplicate our end user API.
- Unable to provide Dagger Components on runtime complicates setup.
Integration is done on compilation level. I could not manage to get that running with the library aproach where we mixing compiled libraries with source code providers.
- current solution will require some refactoring to get that and this may interfere with current work we doing. 
h4. Proposed solution
While I do not recommend dagger I would like to spike Interface based aproach. 
This will be alternative that will simplify user setup to something like this:

Review comment:
This isUndoOrRedo/endIndex logic shouldn't be removed here. It's needed to handle the situation when after some undoing/redoing user goes on with non-historical filters changes, so there's nothing to redo. Sorry for my omission in previous comment.
P.S. Getting rid of hasNoPendingUndoOrRedo looks OK to me.

BXMSDOC-482,[DOC] Documentation mentions Initiator role which is not in fact implement by BPM Suite yet,"Document URL: 
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_JBoss_BPM_Suite/6.1/html/Development_Guide/sect-Task_Permissions.html
Section Number and Name: 
?12.5.1. Task Permissions Matrix
Describe the issue: 
BPMN2 Spec defines ""Initiator"" in its set of user roles. 
BPM Suite does not have it full implemented and by default it is not visible in our web process designer. Given this we should remove the role ""Initiator"" from our documentations to avoid confusion with users that are not able to use it.
Suggestions for improvement: 
Remove any Initiator mention or say that it is not full implemented yet.","[comments]

The Integration Stack is an aggregation of Eclipse features and plugins comprised of JBoss tooling in support of Data Virtualization, BRMS/BPMS, SOA Tooling and legacy SOA 5.x development. It is formed by three Maven projects which produce Eclipse p2 update sites, Mylyn discovery update mechanisms augmenting JBoss Central and an aggregation of associated component target dependencies and JBoss Core tooling target dependencies. The p2 update sites are comprised of Final/GA and early-access repositories and offline zips files. The target dependencies take the form of generated .target files (tycho mojo) and a target p2 update repositories split along Final/early-access and community/production lines.
The project covers both community (JBTIS), production (JBDSIS) and the target platform.
Note that Fuse Tooling has moved to JBIDE / JBDS as of Jun 13, 2017. JBoss Tools is a set of plugins for Eclipse that complements, enhances and goes beyond the support that exists for JBoss and related technologies in the default Eclipse distribution.

fnigro$*$I'm preparing a zip to test the fix (on wildfly) here: https://github.com/franz1981/wildfly/commit/2f2f7495fd61cbe5387d1f8a3ff8a09a807eb172
[~eduda] If it will works I will push a PR to the [~jmesnil] branch of WildFly in order to solve WFLY-10678 as well
martyn-taylor$*$[~fnigro] What was the outcome of this dev task.  Did you make any changed to Artemis?
fnigro$*$To fix this I see 2 options: 
# leave the eap test suite mirror as it is (ie using lower case table names letters) and just makes uses of https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARTEMIS-1979; I will need (probably) to fix the SQL configuration of wildfly as well
# change the table names on the eap test suite, but it would makes the eap test suite mirror divergent from the original one
Given that it is preferred to not change the eap test suite if it won't embededd this change, I would just change the wildfly branch (if needed): probably it would be changed of EAP as well, given that https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARTEMIS-1979 will port the change into EAP cherry-picking it from Artemis 1.x.
[~eduda] wdyt?
fnigro$*$[~martyn-taylor] I have made a change of Artemis https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARTEMIS-1979 (it is referenced into the  https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WFLY-10678 issue).
That fix isn't enough to allow the test to pass: it needs a change into wildfly as well (https://github.com/mtaylor/wildfly/pull/1).
The test I have run was having both (broker + wildfly) commits in.
I suppose that EAP to solve WFLY-10678 need me to cherry-pick the artemis commit into 1.x and EAP + updating wildfly as well (through [~jmesnil] help).

Realistically different servers in the failover list should behave similarly here, so continuing to attempt connection is likely to be futile and lead to a delay signalling the issue when the allowed attempts run out. When the SASL process fails with an outcome other than sys-temp, further [re]connection attempts should stop.","[comments]
jdanek$*$Is the broker supposed to return SASL failure every time auth fails, or only if I was providing username and password?
I have a test which uses {{factory.createConnection()}} (that is, without username and password), and if I delete GuestLoginModule from {{etc/login.conf}}, the auth fails, but I do not get real auth error from the Artemis broker.

iweiss$*$Correcting myself. I was running an old build of EAP 7.x branch. After updating and rebuilding it I no longer see this issue.
[~olukas], can you repeat the test please with the latest EAP 7.x branch build and/or ER3 please?
brian.stansberry$*$Is the HTTP over EJB aspect necessary to reproduce this? It adds a complicating factor that I'm not sure is relevant.
brian.stansberry$*$If the deployment is deployed before the  /subsystem=ejb3/application-security-domain=other:add(security-domain=ApplicationDomain) call and is not redeployed after, then this is not a bug. The software functions as designed. The settings in place when the deployment is deployed remain in effect until the deployment is redeployed (with a server reload or restart counting as one way to redeploy.) The :add operation does not require reload because it immediately alters the way the server will process the deployment of an application; no reload is necessary. Wanting an already processed deployment to automatically pick up the changed settings without a redeploy is an Enhancement request.
If a new deployment is deployed, or an existing deployment is redeployed, after the /subsystem=ejb3/application-security-domain=other:add(security-domain=ApplicationDomain) call and the settings are not reflected in the behavior of that deployment, then that is a bug, as the software is not functioning as designed. But Ingo's testing shows that is not the case.
olukas$*$[~brian.stansberry] Thanks for clarification. In that case this issue is not a bug.
mjurc$*$[~brian.stansberry]: I do not think so. I think that this is result of the Elytron security domains being associated with deployments at their deploy, so if the {{application-security-domain}} is added after deployment, the Elytron security domain does not get associated to deployment.
olukas$*$[~iweiss] Sorry for late answer - I was sick last week.
I tried this issue with EAP 7.1.0.ER3 and it seems that issue still occurs there. I think this should be reopened.
Issue has been resolved with ""cannot reproduce bug"". Do you say that in Steps to Reproduce, in step 3), after calling {{/subsystem=ejb3/application-security-domain=other:add(security-domain=ApplicationDomain)}} you are able to correctly authenticate with EJB client (before reload the server)?
iweiss$*$I can reproduce the issue. I will work on it.
iweiss$*$[~brian.stansberry] Deploying the server application after {{/subsystem=ejb3/application-security-domain=other:add()}} and trying to access it without a reload fails. After a reload, then, it works as expected.
I will work on it from this perspective. I failed to mention that WildFly master works without a reload, so this issue is isolated to EAP 7.x branch.

jgallaso$*$[~davidmartin] [~peter.braun] [~darahayes]
Currently the integration test is failing due to a backend error (1) and additionally another bug has been found in the SDK (2). It is worth mention they are already known and that a workaround exists.
1. From the server side (aerogear-app-metrics) there's a limitation for the size of field ""clientId"" that makes the server returns an Internal error:
{noformat}
{
""error"": ""Internal Server Error"",
""message"": ""Internal Server Error"",
""statusCode"": 500
}
{noformat}
From the client side there is (likely) a bug that triggers a NPE, in [NetworkMetricsPublisher|https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-android-sdk/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/aerogear/mobile/core/metrics/publisher/NetworkMetricsPublisher.java#L60] , {{httpResponse.getRequestError()}} returns null.

Likewise, if the sync call fails because of a collision, core will have to negotiate to fix the error.

AEROGEAR-5552,Allow to override dependency when importing AeroGear Services IOS SDK,"h4. Motivation 
SDK can depend on external dependencies like alamofire. 
Alamofire is really popular networking library and it may be used in the user application.
Having two different versions of the same library will cause conflict on build.
Users will need to change their version to comply with our version, which is not acceptable aproach.
This problem is really well described and mentioned in many bugs. 
For example:
https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/461
We will need to figure out solution the same as we done on Android when we decided to use BOM version management.

wtrocki$*$Initial investigation finished:
Common solution is to provide wide version range for dependencies - never fixed version as this will cause conflicts for others.
However we cannot really say and test many use cases as our modules are now linked as development pods:
!Screen Shot 2018-01-29 at 2.31.54 PM.png|thumbnail! 
When conflict happens it's it's usually because invalid version ranges:
{code}
[!] CocoaPods could not find compatible versions for pod ""Alamofire"":
In Podfile:
AGSCore (from `../modules/core`) was resolved to 1.0.0, which depends on
Alamofire (= 4.6.0)
Alamofire (< 4.5)

Going to adjust ranges in PR.
wtrocki$*$Specified ranges are really wide. I researched option to ask people to import alamofire directly in the application.That could be alternative but I do not think that we want to that at this point.
Another alternative will be to use Framework that offers namespaces, but this will prevent us from modular architecture.
wtrocki$*$After talk with [~danielpassos] we agreed that we cannot ignore that issue as this will be huge limitation for the SDK developers.
